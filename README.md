#Lichtgeschwindigkeit

Lichtgeschwindigkeit ("light-speed") is a space-based physics game in which the user progresses through levels by guiding a spaceship between increasingly difficult arrangements of planets. The ship's movements and appearance are affected by gravity and special relativity, and the majority of the game's levels focus on briefly teaching basic concepts of special relativity.

To run the game, Python 2.7 and Tkinter are required. Opening the file lichtgeschwindigkeit.py from the folder of the same name will run the game.
